Known issues:
---

* A short pause when enabling the Equalizer is needed to find out the current audio app.
* Equalizer doesn't work with some apps that don't provide track information, so that we can't apply the equalizer.
  You can contact the app developers and suggest them supporting the standard Android API, link them to [this simple guide](EQUALIZER_BROADCAST.md).
  Here's a full list of music players lacking support:
  * SoundCloud
  * Pocket Cast
  * YouTube
  * Deezer
  * Spotify doesn't fully support the standard. (We do our best to still support Spotify but it may not work sometimes.)
